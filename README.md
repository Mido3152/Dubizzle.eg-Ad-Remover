# Dubizzle.eg Ad Remover

This is my attempt at a browser extension that completely removes paid-for ads from dubizzle.eg, so that all ads are by real, genuine people looking to sell their property.

## Installation

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Mido3152/Dubizzle.eg-Ad-Remover/releases/tag/release-1.0).

## Building From Source

- Clone the GitHub repo.
  bash`git clone https://github.com/Mido3152/Dubizzle.eg-Ad-Remover.git`
  -Go into your browser's extension menu and enable developer mode.

- Either `load unpacked`, or `pack extension` and refer to the Installation section.
