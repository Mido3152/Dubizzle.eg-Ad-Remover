# Dubizzle.eg Ad Remover

This is my attempt at a browser extension that completely removes paid-for ads from dubizzle.eg, so that all ads are by real, genuine people looking to sell their property.

## Installation

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Mido3152/Dubizzle.eg-Ad-Remover/releases/).

- Drag the `.zip` file and drop it manually into the extensions page of the browser(Developer Mode might be needed.).

### Shipping to Chrome Webstore and Firefox Add-ons Soon!
